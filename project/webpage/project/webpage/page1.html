                <h2> Nepali Traditions and Holidays </h2>
                <p> Nepal has two main religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, although many Nepalese practice a unique combination of both mixed with a degree of animism. The traditions of both go back over two millennia to the birth of the Buddha in Lumbini and the ancient Hindu rituals still strong today. </p>

                <h2> Nepali Food</h2>
                <p> Nepalese cuisine comprises a variety of cuisines based upon ethnicity, soil and climate relating to Nepal's cultural diversity and geography. Dal-bhat-tarkari (Nepali: दाल भात तरकारी) is eaten throughout Nepal. Dal is a soup made of lentils and spices, served over boiled grain, bhat—usually rice but sometimes another grain - and a vegetable curry, tarkari. </p>
                <p> Condiments are usually small amounts of spicy pickle (achaar, अचार) which can be fresh or fermented, (mainly of dried spinach called as 'gundruk ko achar') and radish known as 'mula ko achar', and of which there are a considerable number of varieties.[1] Other accompaniments may be sliced lemon (nibuwa) or lime (kagati) with fresh green chilli (hariyo khursani) and a fried papad (thin, crisp disc-shaped food). Dhindo (ढिंडो) is a traditional food of Nepal.</p>
                <p> Much of the cuisine is variations on Asian themes. Momo is a Nepalese style dumpling filled with minced meat in a flour dough, given different shapes and then cooked by steaming. </p>
