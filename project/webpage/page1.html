                            <h2> Nepali Traditions and Holidays </h2>
                            <p> Nepal has two main religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, although many Nepalese practice a unique combination of both mixed with a degree of animism. The traditions of both go back over two millennia to the birth of the Buddha in Lumbini and the ancient Hindu rituals still strong today. </p>
                            <p> Held over two weeks at the end of September, Dashain is Nepal’s most important festival, celebrated across the land and ending on the day of the full moon. Dashain honors the victory of the gods over a host of demons, based on tales in the Ramayana, after invoking the powers of the goddess Durga.</p>

Dal is a soup made of lentils and spices, served over boiled grain, bhat—usually rice but sometimes another grain - and a vegetable curry, tarkari. </p>
